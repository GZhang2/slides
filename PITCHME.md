* Enter study details - 5 min
* Each phyloreference with initial validation - 2 to 5 min
* Overall validation -

### Some conceptual issues (not directly bearing on curation)

---

Internal node is absent

---
Alligatoroidea as a stem-based definition is labeled along branch, not at a node: "Alligator mississippiensis and all crocodylians closer to it than to Crocodylus niloticus or Gavialis gangeticus."
